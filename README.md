# Mario Kart Wii Tool-Assisted Speedrun Database
A one-stop shop to view all Nintendo track "Best Known Times" (BKTs) and current work-in-progress (WIPs) for Mario Kart Wii Tool-Assisted Speedruns.

## Todo
- Implement Discord Bot to create commits based off of messages posted to #collab-rksys. Otherwise, post notification in #collab-rksys if a commit is manually created on GitHub (if possible)
  - If user uploads directly, do we have a lists of pre-approved users or do we maintain a moderation process?
- Create folder hierarchy and establish how to organize BKTs vs. WIPs, and how to handle categories.
- Determine whether the repo should be public or limited to private chat members who wish to view it
